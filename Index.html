    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    In this new era of technology the world is advancing towards new innovative technologies like robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. The rapid advancement in technology has brought in some form of automation in many industries today. Though lot of human activities are automated in the present competitive world. But a little attention is paid towards most basic and essential things like proper cleaning of utensils which can affect our hygiene and can be a reason for our health issues. Although people have tried to explore in this area and developed some automatic dishwashers but they are not efficient and consumes a lot of water. Some machines uses high velocity water only; hence there is a chance of partial cleansing and not removing tough strains in dishes. In order to overcome the above problems we have developed a special machine called ―”Automatic Dishwasher Machine” with rollers, brush and water jet introduced in this work. The main objective of our project is effective cleaning of utensils and to minimize the wastage of water so that it can be used in large scale areas like mega kitchens and hostel mess where cleaning is unhygienic and tones of water is wasted everyday.
